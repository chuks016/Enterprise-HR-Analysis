# Enterprise HR Analysis

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing an HR dataset to extract actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and support HR strategies. The dataset includes comprehensive information about employees, such as demographic details, performance metrics, training records, and employment classifications. The analysis aims to identify key trends, improve workforce efficiency, and optimise training expenditures.

### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is structured to simulate real-world HR records for analytical purposes. It encompasses multiple aspects of employee data to facilitate a meaningful exploration of workforce dynamics.

### Tools
